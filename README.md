# Java-Sudoku
In this project i created an auto-solving sudoku.
first of all the program will print to the screen â€œWelcome to FATMA SODUKO 2022. To start, press enter" until the user will print "enter" .
then, the user will locate an number and its location, for example for entering number 9 in the location (0,1), he will write 01-9.
the program will receive numbers until the input will be 00-0 and then will complete the board .
